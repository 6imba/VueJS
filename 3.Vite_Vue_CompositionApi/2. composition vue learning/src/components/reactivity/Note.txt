# State:
    - In the context of front-end development, the terms "component state" and "store state" refer to different concepts related to managing and storing data in an application.
    - The specific term used for component state is "local state" or "component-level state."
    - The specific term used for store state is often referred to as "global state" or "application state."


# Reactive state:
    - ref: Reactive References
    - reactive: Reactive Objects
    - computed: Computed Properties
    - getters
    > These properties will automatically update the view when their values change, thanks to Vue's reactivity system.
    - Reactive Arrays (ref vs. reactive)

# Reactivity utilities:
    - isRef()
    - isReactive()
    - isProxy()
    - unref()
    - toRef()
    - isRefs()
