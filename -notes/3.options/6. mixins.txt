- mixin in vue allow us to share/reuse funtionalities instead duplicating it(funtionalities) across multiple components.
    - mixins means a chunck of code we can use it over and over again in different places.

- funtionalities here means, options of vue component.
    - some of options that we can specify in mixins are data, methods, watchers, computed, life cycle hooks.

# general structure of mixins: src/mixins/files.js folder

- merging of same options in component and mixins.
    - default components's option get priority.

# cons of mixins:
    - we cannot pass any data into mixins to customize it, which sometime create issue while re-using.

- Vue@2 mixin VS Vue@3 composables
