# Lifecycle phases a component goes through.
# And we have hooks to execute code in every particular phase.

# Life cycle of component: Different #phases a component have to go through in a vue application.

# Component goes through 4 phases:
    - Creation
    - Mounting
    - Updating
    - Unmounting

- Vue lifecycle hooks are the method that alllows us to hook/tap/attach/implement into these phase of a component_lifecycle.
- and execute some code when hooks is triggered.
- particular hooks is triggered when component reached at particular lifecycle phase.
- There are total 13 lifecycle hooks we can used in component.
# Lifecyle methods/hook are invoked explicitely when a component is detech/reach/trigger it's corresponding lifecycle_phase of a component.

1. Creation phase:
    - tap/hook two methods into this phase: beforeCreate(),created().
        - beforeCreate: before creating VDOM
        - created(): before creating VDOM. data,methods,computed,watch,api_calls,

2. Mounting phase: component_template/html gets mounted into the DOM which you see in the browser.
    - tap/hook two methods into this phase: beforeMount(),mounted().
        - beforeMount: before rendering VDOM into Actual DOM
        - mounted(): after rendering VDOM into Actual DOM
    - purpose of this phase is triggered: manipulate component before or after mountation in DOM.

3. Updation phase: 
    - tap/hook two methods into this phase: beforeUpdate(),updated().
    - this hook is triggered:
        - beforeUpdate: before the reactive_property(data,computed_properties,...) used by the component changes.
        - updated: when re-rendering component the UI

4. unMount phase: 
    - this phase is triggered:
        - when this component is about to removed from the DOM.
    - tap/hook two methods into this phase: beforeuNMOUNT(),unmounted().

5. MISC:
    - activated, deactivated, erroCaptured, renderTracked, renderTriggered.
