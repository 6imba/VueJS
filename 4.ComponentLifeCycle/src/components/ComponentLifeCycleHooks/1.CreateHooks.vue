    # Phases in LifeCycle of a single vue component:
        1. Create: structure
        2. Mount: data-property
        3. Update: update-data-property
        4. Unmount: hide

    # Vue Component Life Cycle Methods:
        - We implement these phases in a component with the help of vue_life_cycle_methods_hooks.
        - each phase/event have a two method before and after.

        1. Create: structure
            - beforeCreated
            - Created
            - The difference between is the beforeCreated hook is before an instance has been fully initialized whereas the created hook is after an instance is created.

    # There are 13 of Vueâ€™s lifecycle hooks according to the latest Official Vue documentation.
        beforeCreate and created
